        <p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <em><q>No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another.</q></em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>So made another drawing.</p>
        <img width="110" height="100" src="../images/5.jpg" alt="">
        <p>My friend smiled gently and indulgently.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <em><q>You see yourself." he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns.</q></em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>
        <p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <em><q>This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time.</q></em>
        </blockquote>
        <img width="100" height="90" src="../images/8.jpg" alt="">
        <p>By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.</p>
        <img width="200" height="90" src="../images/7.jpg" alt="">
        <p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <em><q>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</q></em>
        </blockquote></small>
